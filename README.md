# Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE)

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE), a generative model introduced in the paper "Multimodal Generative Models for Scalable Weakly-Supervised Learning" by Mike Wu and Noah Goodman. This implementation is part of a machine learning class project conducted at TU Berlin.

The project focuses on exploring the MVAE's capability to efficiently learn joint representations from multiple modalities using a variational autoencoder approach.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch

### Installation and usage

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MVAE-project.git
   cd MVAE-project
   ```


1. Run the main script of the MVAE:

   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```
